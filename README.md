# L1-and-L2-Regularization
What is L1 and L2 regularization? L1 Regularization, also called a lasso regression, adds the “absolute value of magnitude” of the coefficient as a penalty term to the loss function. L2 Regularization, also called a ridge regression, adds the “squared magnitude” of the coefficient as the penalty term to the loss function.
